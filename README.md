# DeselectOwnGizmos

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that adds the ability to deselect the user's own gizmos

Added deselect to Logix ToolTip as well

Currently has partial support for gizmos created by inspectors
 - If you are in someone else's world gizmos you create via inspectors will actually be created by you
 - If you are host inspectors will still create gizmos as you unless that user also has the mod

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [DeselectOwnGizmos.dll](https://github.com/badhaloninja/DeselectOwnGizmos/releases/latest/download/DeselectOwnGizmos.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
